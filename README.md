This is about web Data Srapping, Analysis and Visualization with Python. 
The dataset we are going to use is the "Birthday list" on NairaLand home page (i.e: NairaLand Forum Members' Birthday Data).
We will attempt to aswser some useful questions on the dataset.

In other for us to be comfortable in carrying out the above task,
we need some kind of Hacking skills, Math & statistics knowledge and Substantive expertise in the data we intend to use.

a) How many members are celebrating their birthdays today?
b) Who is the oldest and youngest member celebrating his/her birthdays today?
c) What is the average age the celebrants?
